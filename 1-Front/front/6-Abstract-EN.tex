Blockchain-based distributed storage systems offer enhanced security, transparency, and lower costs compared to traditional centralized storage, making them ideal for peer-to-peer collaboration. 
However, their lower transaction processing speed and higher computational requirements demands restrict their deployment in high-density data scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT).

To solve the inefficiency of existing blockchain storage solutions in the IoT time series data scenario, this paper proposes a basic storage architecture for IoT time series data based on the off-chain storage solution.
The system batches discrete time series data and stores only the hash value of each batch on the chain, while the complete data is retained off-chain.
This approach significantly reduces the storage overhead on the blockchain and reduces storage latency by 37.4 times.

However, this basic architecture still has shortcomings in query performance.
To this end, this paper further proposes TimeChain, an efficient and trusted storage system for IoT time series data based on blockchain.
In order to reduce the additional transmission latency in range queries, TimeChain employs an adaptive packaging mechanism. 
TimeChain converts the batching problem to a graph partitioning problem by representing data and historical co-query as graph vertices and edge weights respectively.
To reduce the size of the transmission size in data integrity verification, TimeChain adopts a data integrity verification mechanism based on Local Sensitive Hash (LSH) trees.
TimeChain also integrates a node selection mechanism based on consensus protocol, which reduces the overhead by combining node selection and consensus processes.

This paper implements TimeChain based on top of production-ready open-source components such as Hyperledger Fabric and IPFS, and evaluate the performance of TimeChain. 
The result shows that compared to existing blockchain-based storage systems, TimeChain reduces 64.6\% query latency and 35.3\% storage latency on average.
